# cars-data-analysis
This project related to data analysis of cars Present in India.It’s a B2B based end-to-end product for a car company that wants to introduce a car into the Indian market. It will help them to analyze the Indian market moreover different perspectives. 
Along with the analysis, a model is also built over the present cars which will help to predict the price of the car based on input parameters.
This does not end here. You ‘ll also be provided with a driving experience of the car with similar attributes in a mini game-like environment

# Price Prediction Model
This is based on deep learning approach where i have used sequential modeling and added keras dense layers with Relu activations

# Data analysis
Mainly for data analysis K-means Clustering is used and different graphs are being plotted over it using plotly library

# Game
A game is also made over the the model where after the price prediction the user can play the mini game for real simulations
